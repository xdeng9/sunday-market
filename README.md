## Code Snippets

We use AWS S3 to support image storage and limit the size of the files allowed to be uploaded.

```javascript
  const imgUpload = multer({
    storage: multerS3({
      s3: s3,
      bucket: "sundaymarketbucket",
      acl: "public-read",
      key: function (req, file, cb) {
        cb(
          null,
          path.basename(file.originalname, path.extname(file.originalname)) +
            "-" +
            Date.now() +
            path.extname(file.originalname)
        );
      },
    }),
    limits: { fileSize: 3000000 }, 
    fileFilter: function (req, file, cb) {
      checkFileType(file, cb);
    },
  }).single("listingImage");
```
